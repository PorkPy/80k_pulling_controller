This model used the data collected by having the robot move out in straight lines from the orifice out to about 1m at angles [0-90]degrees.
This is a very simplistic dataset for machine learning, but is meant to act as an starting point with which to compare the hand derived physics model. 
To help the model learn, extra synthetic data points were added where the features [angle, hose size, orifice size] were slightly adjustment from the real values. The target feature [force] was kept constant.
